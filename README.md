# CrashExcuseSaver
This is a screen-saver for Haiku that displays messages based on common technical excuses.
The excuses are currently obtained from the ```/boot/system/data/fortunes/Tech Support Excuses``` file.

## Building
There are two ways to build the screen-saver. Either open the file ```CrashExcuseSaver.pld``` (you will need to install Paladin from the HaikuDepot) and then build it using the ```Build->Make Project``` menu or use the generated make file by running the ```make``` command.
